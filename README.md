# Routes

## GET /api/login
This link is for getting the token for Authorization (for this project, the token is stored in Cache)

## GET /api/users
This link is for entering the names.

## POST /api/users/submit ENDPOINT

This link is for posting first and last names that the program could tidy up the JSON. It combines both names to a full name.
Also this is the endpoint for the task given by The logic behind.
It can only process a certain type of an array, like in this example:

Input:
{"users": [
{
"first_name": "Tom",
"last_name": "Tucker"
},
{
"first_name": "Tom",
"last_name": "Tucker"
}]}

Output:
{"users":[{"full_name":"Tom Tucker"},{"full_name":"Tom Tucker"}]}.

# Controller
## UserController
The controller has 3 functions:
index() is used for /api/login route to return users view
create() is used for /api/users/submit route to handle the data and return a JSON
login() is used fore /api/login to cache a token

# Middleware
## EnsureTokenIsValid
Used in a group to Authorize /api/users and /api/users/submit routes by getting a token from cache

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
